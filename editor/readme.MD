Node-Based Shader Editor
=========

Node based Shader Editor in webGL done as my final degree's project, a demo can be checked online on http://victhorlopez.github.io/editor/.
Many thanks to my tutor, Javier Agenjo (https://github.com/jagenjo) who advised me throughout the entire project and also provided me with very useful libraries to develop this project.

 * Litegl.js(https://github.com/jagenjo/litegl.js) is a library that wraps WebGL to make it more user-friendly.
 * Litegraph.js(https://github.com/jagenjo/litegraph.js) is the core library of the project used to create graphs and nodes visually.
